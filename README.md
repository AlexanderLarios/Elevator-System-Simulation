# Project1 
Welcome to our repository!
First download the github desktop app or the extension for visual studio.
https://desktop.github.com/
When you are ready to sync up to our project go ahead and create a new test branch of our master branch.

This way you have your own version to work on and all changes will be made to test branches and then committed to the master branch after they are reviewed and merged with any other changes made while you were working.
If you have a branch out locally on your machine for a while I suggest syncing regularlly to see any changes made.

If you want to update the UML diagram just go to draw.io and open with github then go to our UML folder and open the UML.xml file. 
changes to the UML will work just like our code and should be made on a test branch before commiting the changes to our master.

Cheers, 
Alex
