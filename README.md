# Project1  Elevator Simulator

Welcome to our repository!
We are almost done with our Elevator Sim.


At this point we are all working on the same class files so we should just all branch off one branch. Im using Do_Work Branch right now. if we all make sub branches it will help reduce conficts.
Thanks in advance.


Also its not necessary to commit each line one at a time or submit a pull request to master after changing only a line or 2 of code. Keep adding more lines and then commit. Once you feel like you have made a few solid changes go ahead and request the pull to the Do_Work branch and we will merge them and pull to Master.


If you want to update the UML diagram just go to draw.io and open with github then go to our UML folder and open the UML.xml file. Also please publish a pdf update along with the XML. Please make updates to the UML within a branch.
